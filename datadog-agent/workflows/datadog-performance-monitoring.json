  "steps": [
    "- Query Datadog metrics to collect system performance data including CPU, memory, and disk utilization",
    "- Analyze application performance metrics such as response times, throughput, and error rates",
    "- Identify performance bottlenecks and anomalies in the infrastructure",
    "- Calculate performance trends and compare against baseline thresholds",
    "- Generate optimization recommendations for underperforming services",
    "- Compile findings into actionable performance monitoring report",
    "- Alert on critical performance issues that require immediate attention"
