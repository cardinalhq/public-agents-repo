  "objective": "Analyze cloud billing data to identify underutilized services and generate cost optimization recommendations",
  "steps": [
    "- Query BigQuery billing data to identify top cost contributors by project",
    "- Examine Google Cloud Monitoring metrics to determine utilization rates for each service type",
    "- Calculate utilization percentages for services using CPU, memory, and usage metrics",
    "- Identify services with utilization below threshold as underutilized",
    "- Calculate daily costs, projected monthly costs, and potential savings for underutilized services",
    "- Generate remediation recommendations for each underutilized service",
    "- Compile findings into actionable cost optimization report with prioritized action items",
    "- Send concise summary report via Slack to the #alerts-test channel"

  "guardrails": [
    "- Define underutilized services as those with less than threshold utilization",
    "- Include specific attributes for each underutilized service: Service, Utilization %, Daily Cost, Projected Monthly Cost, Remediation Recommendation, Savings",
    "- Generate concise, to-the-point, actionable report",
    "- Focus on services that show clear underutilization with quantifiable savings potential"
